## Post-Institute Chats

CLIR and EDUCAUSE host a regular chat session for all alumni of the Leading Change and Frye Leadership Institutes. Chats are held on the second Friday of every month except July and August at 11:30 AM Eastern time.

The hour-long discussions will be moderated by the Institute's deans, Joanne Kossuth and Elliott Shore, and will focus on a variety of topics of interest to alumni. These sessions are private and only those who have attended the Institute may participate. Reminders will be sent round the all-class email list prior to each chat. If you misplace or do not receive the message with the meeting information, please contact <a href="">us</a>.

## Email List

Institute fellows are entitled to join two email lists: one for their cohort and one that includes fellows from all previous years. These lists are private and may only be joined by those who have participated in the Institute, so all requests to join, or change one's email address, are handled by CLIR and EDUCAUSE.
