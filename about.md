Since the [inception of the Institute](/history/), key higher education issues have included new sources of competition, use of technology to support effective teaching and learning, distance learning, changing modes of scholarly communications, an increasing focus on students and, fundamentally, a transformation in the qualities necessary for leadership in today's increasingly ambiguous and rapidly changing environment. These issues continue to frame the complex landscape of higher education and to inform the Leading Change Institute's scope.

Together with the deans and other thought leaders from the community, fellows in the Institute contemplate the current and future impact of these issues in the higher education community. They discuss numerous approaches to addressing these issues, including ideas for collaboration, collective creativity, and innovation within and across departments, institutions, and local or regional boundaries; the conceptualization of blended positions and organizations; and the importance of community mentorship and advocacy. Speakers from a wide range of backgrounds share real-life problems across the higher education landscape for which, over the course of the Institute, participants are challenged to devise and propose solutions.

## Who Should Attend?

The Leading Change Institute is designed for leaders in higher education, including CIOs, librarians, information technology professionals, and administrators, who are interested in working collaboratively to promote and initiate change on critical issues affecting the academy.

Selection to the Institute is competitive. Each class cohort reflects the diverse and dynamic spectrum of experience found in the current higher education workplace. Leaders with at least seven years' experience in the college or university environment are invited to apply, as are those who come from business, governmental or non-profit backgrounds. Because the Institute is continually evolving to reflect and address current issues, those who have attended previous Institutes are also welcome to apply.

LCI fellows are willing and eager to explore different models and take risks. They have a commitment to, and talent for, leadership within higher education. They understand and appreciate the environment outside their immediate surroundings; they strive to build bridges between people, departments and institutions; they are critical thinkers and dynamic and creative problem-solvers. Successful candidates will demonstrate their strengths and leadership ability in these areas in their applications.
