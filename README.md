# Leading Change Institute

## Updating Slider

- Create a new image in `img/slider/` with a maximum width of 1024px
  (and optimize with [imageoptim](https://imageoptim.com/)).
- Update `_includes/slider.html` with image name, heading, and
  description (and link if applicable).
- Add the new image in `git` (`git add img`)
- Commit the change (`git commit -am "Added awesome new image"`)
- Deploy the change to the server (`git push origin gh-pages`)




## TODO

- Landing page images and quotes
- Rewrite index#about...what's the hook?
- Get real quotes for index#quotes
- Document `institutes` content type
- Default /fellows/ is the most current institute page
- Alumni has a list of fellows and a link to that institute page
- Look at `data` component for alumni/participants
- Document how to do this process
